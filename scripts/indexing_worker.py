Standalone Slurm worker for admin-triggered dataset size indexing.

Deliberately NOT part of the FastAPI app's request/response cycle — RCAC
policy on Anvil's login nodes is job prep/submission/monitoring only, no
sustained background work, so this has to be a real Slurm job. And because
pelican-ui runs per-user via PUN, having each user's own process submit its
own Slurm job would hit the same "not every user is in the charged
allocation" problem already solved once for the project-folder picker — so
this script is submitted manually, once, by one identity, and keeps itself
alive across Anvil's 96-hour hard walltime cap by resubmitting itself near
the end of each cycle (see _maybe_resubmit_and_exit below) rather than a
human re-running it.

Usage on Anvil: `sbatch scripts/indexing_worker.sbatch` (see that file for
the #SBATCH resource header) starts the first cycle. This script assumes
it's already running inside an allocated job — it never calls sbatch for
its OWN first invocation, only to queue the next cycle.

# Connection-pressure safeguards (2026-08-04 investigation): pelicanfs's own

# never reuses one across calls — third-party behavior this worker can't
# change without touching pelicanfs source (out of scope, see that
# investigation's report). Sustained over tens of thousands of calls in one
# continuous multi-hour process, this is consistent with the observed
# "healthy for hours, then a wall" pattern (TCP TIME_WAIT / ephemeral-port /
# file-descriptor pressure building until new connections can't be
# established). Two safeguards mitigate this entirely from pelican-ui's own
# code, without touching pelicanfs/aiowebdav2 — see list_path() in
# _index_dataset for where both are applied:
#   - proactive (PROACTIVE_RESET_CALLS): drop and recreate the shared
#     filesystem singleton every N .ls() calls, well before pressure has a
#     chance to build toward the failure point. The real failure log's
#     first healthy dataset made it 40,200 calls over 3+ hours before any
#     sign of trouble, and the *next* dataset — starting from a process
#     that already carried that accumulated pressure — failed after only
#     ~29 minutes, nowhere near that count on its own. That gap between
#     "still fine at 40,200" and "already struggling well before that on a
#     pressured process" is exactly why this threshold is deliberately an
#     order of magnitude under the first number, not tuned tight against
#     it — the real safe ceiling isn't known, and an unnecessary reset is
#     nearly free (recreating one filesystem object), while resetting too
#     late risks hitting the wall anyway. This is a starting point meant to

# observed actively making worse, a different failure shape: sustained
# origin/Director unreachability. Real evidence, 2026-08-05, dataset_id=3
# (noaa-goes18): every single folder across a ~20-hour span (the entire
# ABI-L1b-RadM/2023-2026 day-of-year tree, then a long run of ABI-L2-*
# product folders) failed with fsspec.exceptions.FSTimeoutError, always
# only after exhausting the full 4-attempt/~90-110s retry cycle, never
# once succeeding on a fresh post-reset attempt.
#
# Traced to source by reading the installed pelicanfs package directly and
# reproducing the exception chain: FSTimeoutError comes from pelicanfs's
# get_dirlist_url() (Director PROPFIND resolution, which runs before the
# actual listing call), which uses a *hardcoded* 5-second
# aiohttp.ClientTimeout with no try/except around it (unlike the sibling
# cache-selection loop in get_working_cache, which does catch its own
# timeout and treats it as "try the next cache") — and that 5s value isn't
# exposed through any pelicanfs/OSDFFileSystem constructor kwarg. Per this
# project's standing convention against touching third-party source, that
# timeout value itself is not something pelican-ui's own code can adjust;
# a Director that's sustained-degraded (or simply can't answer a
# particular request pattern within 5s) will keep producing this exact
# failure regardless of how many times list_path resets and retries —

# between, treat that as confirmed evidence of sustained origin trouble
# rather than a run of bad luck, and abort the dataset immediately instead
# of paying the full ~90-110s retry cost on every remaining folder — at
# the real noaa-goes18 run's rate, a dataset this deep would otherwise
# take weeks to exhaust its walk while still recording a wildly wrong
# near-zero total, exactly the failure mode this circuit breaker exists to
# close. 5 is deliberately small as a *folder* count, but not as an
# *attempt* count: each folder counted here already cost 4 real requests
# against the origin over ~90-110s (the existing retry loop's own cost,
# not additional load this change introduces), so 5 consecutive failures
# is already ~20 real requests spread over roughly 7.5-9 minutes — enough
# to be confident it isn't coincidence, without waiting much longer to act
# on it. A single confirmed data-class response (a real 404/401/403) or a
# single successful listing anywhere in between resets the count to 0 —
# see walk()'s own handling — so a genuinely recovering or merely-flaky
# origin does not trip this. A reasoned starting point, same spirit as

            not_found/permission — a genuine, well-understood non-connection
            failure, e.g. a real RemoteResourceNotFoundError): zero retries,
            propagates immediately, unchanged from before this retry-loop
            work. Reuses classify_failure rather than a fresh check here so
            this stays in sync with the same categories the admin
            panel/downloads/Quick Access already treat as "confirmed,
            don't-retry" shapes of failure — no separate classification
            scheme to keep in sync by hand.

        never increment _ls_call_count themselves (each connection-class
        retry already resets it to 0 via reset_default_filesystem), so
        there's no special-casing needed for a proactive threshold being
