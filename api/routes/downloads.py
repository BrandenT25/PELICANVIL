def _recover_interrupted_jobs() -> None:
    """Called once at process start, right after _init_db() — same
    "best-effort work done once per PUN process import" convention as
    main.py's migrate_category_icons() (wrapped in try/except there for the
    same reason this call site is below).

    GitHub issue #6, Part 3: if the PUN process dies mid-download (Passenger
    recycling, an app restart, a node/session issue), the background thread
    running _run_download_job dies with it, without ever reaching its own
    terminal _update_job/_finish_history_record calls — so that job's
    download_jobs row is left stuck at whatever status ('pending' if the
    executor hadn't even picked it up yet, 'in_progress' otherwise) it last
    had, and its download_history counterpart stays 'in_progress' forever
    too. There was previously no code anywhere that detected this on the
    next process start — confirmed directly by reading
    api/core/indexing_queue.py's own recover_interrupted(), whose docstring
    states this gap explicitly (that function exists for the separate
    indexing worker's own, structurally different, interrupted-job problem).

    Detection needs no new state: a live process's _run_download_job always
    drives a row through to a terminal status (complete/partial/failed)
    before returning, exceptions included (see its own try/except Exception
    fallback) — so a row parked at 'pending' or 'in_progress' at the moment
    this function runs, before this fresh process has submitted anything of
    its own yet, can only be left over from a *previous* process's death.

    Resume, not just retry-from-scratch: download_jobs.files is written
    after every single file (_run_download_job's _update_job(job_id,
    files=files) inside its per-file loop, not just at the end), so the
    last commit before death already has real per-file status. Files
    already "succeeded" are preserved untouched; everything else — "failed",
    "pending" (never attempted), and "retrying" (a manual restart that was
    itself interrupted this time) — all get re-enqueued, since none of
    those represent completed, verified work. Checking status != "succeeded"
    rather than listing every non-terminal status by name is deliberate:
    "retrying" is swept into the same retry bucket as "failed"/"pending"
    here, not silently dropped or treated as some fourth case.

    Keeps the same job_id rather than minting a new one (unlike a manual
    restart via _restart_files/_enqueue_job) — datasets.js's pollDownloadJob
    treats a non-ok response (e.g. a 404 from a deleted-and-recreated job
    row) as a transient hiccup and keeps polling the *same* job_id up to
    DOWNLOAD_POLL_MAX_ATTEMPTS; it has no way to learn about a replacement
    job_id. Minting a new one would silently orphan any browser tab that
    happened to still have an open toast polling the old id across the
    restart. The Downloads history page doesn't care either way, since it
    re-queries job_id fresh via listDownloadHistory's LEFT JOIN on every
    load.

    Multi-process guard: claims each row with an atomic
    UPDATE ... WHERE status IN ('pending', 'in_progress') before doing
    anything else with it, checking rowcount. _db_write_lock's own docstring
    already notes it doesn't protect against a second OS process (only
    against this process's own threads racing each other); if Passenger
    ever runs more than one worker process for the same user, two processes
    starting at once could otherwise both read the same stale row and both
    re-enqueue the same download. SQLite only ever allows one writer at a
    time regardless, so only one process's claim UPDATE can actually change
    the row; the loser's rowcount comes back 0 and it skips that row rather
    than double-enqueuing it.

    No toast/push notification here — nobody's browser is guaranteed
    connected at process cold-start, so there's no channel to push to
    anyway. The resumed row simply shows 'in_progress' again, identical to
    any other in-progress download, next time anything reads it — the
    Downloads page's existing polling/rendering already handles that state
    with no changes needed (confirmed by reading downloads.js/datasets.js:
    both key off job_id + status alone, neither cares how a row got into
    'in_progress').

    and restartDownloadFile (retries one specific file) — both reduce to
    "reset this history record in place and re-enqueue retry_paths,
    carrying preserved_files forward exactly as they already are." The two
    callers differ only in which files end up in each bucket:
    restartDownloadRecord retries every failed file and preserves the
    succeeded ones; restartDownloadFile retries just the one requested path
    and preserves everything else untouched — including any *other* still-
    failed files, which must stay failed, not be silently retried or
    cleared, since only one path was asked for (see _run_download_job's own
    comment on why nothing here forces preserved entries to "succeeded").
    sizes comes from all_files (the full original list, both callers have
    it) rather than preserved_files alone, since preserved_files never
    includes the retried path(s) and their sizes still need to survive the
    restart the same way preserved files' do.

    What's genuinely different from startDownloadJob, and why this isn't
    just a call to it: restarting is expected to update the *same* history
    entry in place (status flips failed/partial -> in_progress on the entry
    the user clicked Restart on), not create a second entry while the old
    one lingers. startDownloadJob always inserts a fresh history row, so it
    can't produce that in-place behavior — resetting the existing row
    instead of inserting a new one is what this helper does that
    startDownloadJob's own path doesn't need to.
